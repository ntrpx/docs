**The NTRPX Meta System™ is built on a comprehensive biological framework.** Rather than chasing individual ingredients or trends, we mapped the complete terrain of human physiology relevant to cognitive performance, energy, and recovery. The result: 16 distinct biological systems that collectively govern how you think, feel, perform, and restore.

Every NTRPX ingredient targets specific systems. Every formulation is designed with full awareness of how these systems interact. The result is supplementation that works *with* your biology rather than against it.
