# Open Source Biology

<Note>
**NTRPX is built in the open.** Every formula, every mechanism, every clinical citation — documented transparently for the community to review, critique, and improve.
</Note>

We believe the future of human optimization shouldn't be locked behind proprietary formulas and marketing hype. NTRPX is an **open source biology project** — our ingredient research, formulation rationale, and system architecture are all publicly available for scrutiny and collaboration.

## Why Open Source?

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Transparency" icon="eye">
No proprietary blends. No hidden doses. Every ingredient, every milligram, fully disclosed and scientifically justified.
</Card>

<Card title="Collaboration" icon="users">
The best ideas come from diverse perspectives. Scientists, biohackers, clinicians, and curious minds — all welcome.
</Card>

<Card title="Trust" icon="shield-check">
When you can see the work, you can trust the work. Open research builds confidence in what you put in your body.
