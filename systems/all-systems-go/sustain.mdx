# Sustain — Midday Momentum

<Note>
**Keep the engine running clean.** Sustain provides the metabolic support and adaptogenic resilience your brain needs to maintain output through the afternoon — when most people hit the wall.
</Note>

By midday, your morning neurochemical advantages begin to fade. Cortisol starts its descent, neurotransmitter precursors deplete, and cellular energy systems strain under accumulated demand. Sustain addresses each of these vulnerabilities — not with stimulants, but with the substrates and modulators that let your biology sustain itself.

## The Afternoon Problem

Most cognitive stacks focus on morning activation and ignore the harder problem: **maintenance**. Here's what happens after noon:

<Steps>

<Step title="Cortisol Decline">
Cortisol falls from its morning peak, reducing alertness and mobilized energy. This is natural — but the drop can feel like hitting a wall if not managed.
</Step>

<Step title="Neurotransmitter Depletion">
Morning cognitive work depletes acetylcholine, dopamine, and their precursors. Without replenishment, afternoon thinking feels effortful.
</Step>

<Step title="Mitochondrial Strain">
Hours of sustained neural activity tax mitochondrial ATP production. Reactive oxygen species accumulate. Efficiency drops.
</Step>

<Step title="Blood Sugar Fluctuation">
Post-lunch glucose dynamics can trigger drowsiness, brain fog, and the infamous "food coma" — especially with high-carb meals.
</Step>

<Step title="Circadian Dip">
The post-lunch circadian trough (1-3pm) creates a natural low point in alertness, independent of food intake.
</Step>

</Steps>

Sustain targets each of these mechanisms with precision compounds.

## Complete Ingredient Breakdown

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Ashwagandha (KSM-66®) — 300mg" icon="leaf">

**What it does:** The premier adaptogen for stress resilience and cortisol modulation. KSM-66® is a full-spectrum root extract standardized to 5% withanolides — the most clinically-studied ashwagandha on the market.

**Why this dose:** 300mg is the clinically-validated dose showing significant cortisol reduction (-27% in stressed adults) without sedation. Higher doses don't improve efficacy and may cause drowsiness.

**Clinical evidence:**
- **Cortisol:** -27.9% reduction in chronically stressed adults (Chandrasekhar 2012)
- **Anxiety:** -56% reduction in GAD-7 scores (Pratte 2014)
- **Cognition:** Improved reaction time, task performance (Pingali 2014)
- **Endurance:** +13% VO2max improvement in athletes (Choudhary 2015)

**Mechanism pathway:**
```
Withanolides → 11β-HSD1 inhibition → ↓ Cortisol regeneration
           → GABAergic modulation → ↓ Anxiety
           → Mitochondrial support → ↑ Endurance
           → Thyroid optimization → ↑ T4 (if low)
```

<Tip>
**Timing advantage:** Midday ashwagandha catches cortisol as it descends, smoothing the transition rather than fighting a peak. This avoids the over-sedation some experience with morning dosing.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rhodiola rosea (3% Salidroside) — 200mg" icon="mountain">

**What it does:** A stimulating adaptogen that combats fatigue at its source — optimizing stress hormone response while supporting dopaminergic and serotonergic function. The perfect complement to ashwagandha's calming adaptation.

**Why this dose:** 200mg of a quality extract (standardized to 3% salidroside, 1% rosavins) hits the sweet spot for anti-fatigue effects without the jitteriness some experience at higher doses.

**What makes Rhodiola unique:**
- **Anti-fatigue:** Reduces perceived exertion and mental fatigue
- **Stimulating adaptogen:** Provides energy, unlike sedating adaptogens
- **Fast-acting:** Effects noticeable within 30 minutes
- **Mood support:** Modest antidepressant and anxiolytic effects

**Research highlights:**
- Improved attention, cognitive function during stress (Darbinyan 2000)
- Reduced mental fatigue during night shifts (Shevtsov 2003)
- Enhanced physical performance and reduced RPE (De Bock 2004)
- Antidepressant effects comparable to sertraline (Mao 2015)

<Note>
**Adaptogen synergy:** Rhodiola (stimulating) + Ashwagandha (calming) = balanced adaptation. You get the energy without the edge, the calm without the sedation.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ALCAR (Acetyl-L-Carnitine) — 500mg" icon="bolt">

**What it does:** Transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta-oxidation (energy production) while also serving as an acetyl group donor for acetylcholine synthesis. It's both a metabolic and cognitive compound.

**Why this dose:** 500mg provides meaningful mitochondrial and cognitive support. Higher doses (1-2g) are used therapeutically but can cause restlessness and are unnecessary in a balanced stack.

**Dual mechanism:**
```
                    ┌→ Mitochondria → β-oxidation → ATP
ALCAR → Carnitine ─┤
                    └→ Acetyl-CoA → Acetylcholine synthesis
```

**Key benefits:**
- **Mitochondrial:** Enhanced fatty acid oxidation, especially in brain
- **Cognitive:** Acetyl donor supports cholinergic function
- **Neuroprotective:** Reduces oxidative stress in neurons
- **Mood:** Antidepressant effects in multiple trials

**Research highlight:** ALCAR has shown cognitive benefits in age-related decline, chronic fatigue, and depression — suggesting it addresses fundamental energy deficits rather than masking symptoms.

<Tip>
**Afternoon advantage:** As glucose utilization efficiency drops in the afternoon, ALCAR's support of fatty acid metabolism provides an alternative fuel pathway for the brain.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CoQ10 (Ubiquinol) — 100mg" icon="circle-nodes">

**What it does:** Essential electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (Complex I → III). Without adequate CoQ10, ATP production bottlenecks regardless of substrate availability.

**Why Ubiquinol:** The reduced form (ubiquinol) is directly usable, while oxidized CoQ10 (ubiquinone) must be converted first. Ubiquinol has 3-8x better bioavailability, especially as we age when conversion efficiency declines.

**Why this dose:** 100mg of ubiquinol significantly raises plasma and tissue CoQ10 levels. Higher doses are used for specific conditions (heart failure, migraines) but 100mg optimizes healthy mitochondrial function.

**Electron transport chain role:**
```
NADH → Complex I → CoQ10 → Complex III → Cytochrome c → Complex IV → ATP
              ↑
         FADH2 → Complex II
```

**Benefits:**
- **Energy:** Direct ATP production support
- **Antioxidant:** Prevents lipid peroxidation in membranes
- **Cardiovascular:** Supports heart mitochondrial density
- **Statin users:** Repletes CoQ10 depleted by statins

<Warning>
**Statin interaction:** Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway, reducing endogenous CoQ10 synthesis. Anyone on statins should supplement CoQ10 — Sustain provides a meaningful dose.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone) — 20mg" icon="sparkles">

**What it does:** Stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis via PGC-1α activation — literally increasing the number of mitochondria in your cells. Also functions as a potent redox cofactor with antioxidant properties exceeding vitamin C.

**Why this dose:** 20mg is the dose used in human cognitive trials showing improvements in memory and attention. It's also the threshold for measurable increases in mitochondrial biogenesis markers.

**Unique properties:**
- **Biogenesis:** Only supplement proven to increase mitochondrial number
- **Redox cycling:** Can perform thousands of catalytic cycles (vs. single-use for most antioxidants)
- **NGF support:** Stimulates nerve growth factor (synergy with Lion's Mane in Boost)
- **Cognitive:** Improved memory and attention in human trials

**Research highlight (Itoh 2016):**
- 20mg PQQ daily for 12 weeks
- Significant improvement in cognitive function tests
- Enhanced cerebral blood flow on imaging
- Synergistic effects when combined with CoQ10

<Tip>
**Long game:** PQQ's mitochondrial biogenesis effects take weeks to manifest. Acute benefits come from redox support; structural benefits build over months.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Phosphatidylserine — 100mg" icon="hexagon">

**What it does:** A phospholipid critical to cell membrane structure, particularly abundant in neural tissue. Supports membrane fluidity, neurotransmitter release, and cortisol modulation.

**Why this dose:** 100mg provides the cortisol-blunting and cognitive benefits seen in research. Higher doses (300mg+) are used therapeutically but aren't necessary in a comprehensive stack.

**Cortisol modulation mechanism:**
- Phosphatidylserine dampens HPA axis hyperactivity
- Reduces cortisol response to acute stressors
- Particularly effective for exercise-induced cortisol
- Complements ashwagandha via different pathway

**Cognitive benefits:**
- Supports acetylcholine release
- Maintains membrane fluidity for receptor function
- May slow age-related cognitive decline

**Research highlight:** PS supplementation has shown benefits in both young adults under stress and older adults with age-related memory concerns — suggesting it supports fundamental membrane biology.

<Note>
**Source matters:** Modern PS is derived from soy or sunflower lecithin. Early studies used bovine brain PS (no longer available). Plant-derived PS shows similar benefits with no contamination risk.

## Synergies Within All Systems Go

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Boost → Sustain Handoff" icon="arrow-right">
Boost's cholinergic activation creates demand that Sustain's ALCAR and phosphatidylserine help meet. Ashwagandha smooths any cortisol overshoot from morning intensity.
</Card>

<Card title="Sustain → Recover Handoff" icon="arrow-right">
Sustain's adaptogens prepare the HPA axis for evening wind-down. By preventing afternoon cortisol spikes, Recover's sleep compounds work more effectively.
</Card>

</CardGroup>

## Sustain vs. Stimulants

<Tabs>

<Tab title="The Stimulant Approach">
**Afternoon coffee, energy drinks, or additional stimulants:**
- Borrow energy from tonight's sleep
- Create dependency and tolerance
- Spike cortisol when it should be declining
- Disrupt circadian rhythm
- Crash follows the boost
</Tab>

<Tab title="The Sustain Approach">
**Metabolic support and adaptogenic resilience:**
- Generate energy at the mitochondrial level
- Build tolerance to stress over time
- Modulate cortisol, don't spike it
- Support circadian rhythm
- No crash — smooth energy until evening
</Tab>

</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Caffeine timing:** If you use caffeine, keep it before noon to avoid sleep disruption. Sustain is designed to replace afternoon caffeine, not stack with it.
