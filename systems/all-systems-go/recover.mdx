# Recover — Evening Restoration

<Note>
**Sleep is not downtime. It's when the real work happens.** Recover provides the neurochemical support for deep, restorative sleep — the kind that consolidates memories, clears metabolic waste, restores neurotransmitter sensitivity, and sets up tomorrow's performance.
</Note>

The quality of your tomorrow is determined by the quality of tonight's sleep. Not just duration — architecture. Recover targets the specific mechanisms that govern sleep onset, slow-wave depth, and the restorative processes that transform unconscious hours into cognitive capital.

## The Science of Restorative Sleep

Sleep isn't a uniform state — it's a precisely orchestrated sequence of stages, each serving distinct biological functions:

<Steps>

<Step title="Sleep Onset (N1)">
The transition from wake to sleep. Racing thoughts must quiet, muscle tension must release, and core body temperature must drop. This is where most sleep problems occur.
</Step>

<Step title="Light Sleep (N2)">
Sleep spindles and K-complexes appear. Memory consolidation begins. Body temperature continues falling. Heart rate and breathing stabilize.
</Step>

<Step title="Deep Sleep (N3 / Slow-Wave)">
The most restorative phase. Growth hormone surges. Glymphatic clearance removes metabolic waste (including amyloid-β). Immune function peaks. Physical restoration occurs.
</Step>

<Step title="REM Sleep">
Dream sleep. Emotional processing and procedural memory consolidation. Acetylcholine surges while serotonin and norepinephrine go silent. Critical for cognitive function.
</Step>

<Step title="Cycling">
You cycle through these stages 4-6 times per night. Early cycles are N3-heavy (physical restoration). Later cycles are REM-heavy (cognitive restoration). Both matter.
</Step>

</Steps>

Recover supports the entire sequence — especially the onset and deep sleep phases where supplementation has the most impact.

## Complete Ingredient Breakdown

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Magnesium L-Threonate (Magtein®) — 144mg elemental Mg" icon="brain">

**What it does:** The only magnesium form clinically proven to significantly elevate brain magnesium levels. Crosses the blood-brain barrier efficiently, supporting NMDA receptor modulation, synaptic plasticity, and sleep quality.

**Why L-Threonate:** Standard magnesium forms (citrate, glycinate, oxide) raise serum magnesium but minimally impact brain levels. L-Threonate was specifically developed at MIT to address this limitation.

**Why this dose:** 144mg elemental magnesium (from ~2g Magtein®) is the dose used in human trials demonstrating cognitive benefits and sleep improvement. This provides brain-specific effects without the GI issues of high-dose oral magnesium.

**Sleep mechanisms:**
```
Mg-L-Threonate → ↑ Brain Mg²⁺ → NMDA receptor modulation
                              → ↓ Glutamate excitotoxicity
                              → ↑ GABA sensitivity
                              → ↓ Cortisol
                              → ↑ Melatonin (cofactor)
```

**Research highlights:**
- Significant improvement in sleep quality (Abbasi 2012)
- Reversal of brain aging markers in animal models (Bhutto 2010)
- Improved memory and cognitive function (Liu 2016)
- Enhanced synaptic density in prefrontal cortex

<Tip>
**The magnesium-sleep connection:** Up to 50% of adults are magnesium deficient. Deficiency directly impairs sleep quality. For many, magnesium alone produces dramatic sleep improvement.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Glycine — 3g" icon="temperature-low">

**What it does:** Triggers sleep onset through a unique thermoregulatory mechanism — causing peripheral vasodilation that drops core body temperature, which is a primary physiological trigger for sleep initiation.

**Why this dose:** 3g is the clinically-validated dose. Lower doses show minimal effect; higher doses don't improve efficacy. This is one compound where the dose is precise.

**Dual sleep mechanism:**

```
Glycine 3g → Peripheral vasodilation → Core temp ↓ 0.5°C → Sleep onset
         → Glycine receptors (inhibitory) → CNS calming
         → NMDA co-agonist → Synaptic modulation
```

**What makes glycine unique:**
- **Thermoregulation:** Only sleep compound that works via temperature
- **No grogginess:** Unlike GABA agonists, no morning hangover
- **Sleep architecture:** Preserves natural sleep stages
- **Bonus benefits:** Collagen synthesis, glutathione precursor

**Clinical evidence (Inagawa 2006, Bannai 2012):**
- Reduced time to sleep onset
- Improved subjective sleep quality
- Enhanced next-day cognitive performance
- Reduced fatigue after sleep restriction

<Note>
**The temperature trigger:** Your body must drop core temperature ~1°C to initiate sleep. This is why a cool bedroom helps, why a warm bath before bed works (post-bath cooling), and why glycine is so effective — it accelerates this natural process.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="L-Theanine — 200mg" icon="leaf">

**What it does:** Promotes relaxation without sedation by increasing alpha brain wave activity — the same pattern seen in meditation. Also modulates GABA, serotonin, and dopamine in ways that support calm alertness transitioning to sleep.

**Why this dose:** 200mg is the standard effective dose, producing measurable alpha wave increases within 30-40 minutes. This dose promotes relaxation while remaining sub-sedative.

**Mechanism of calm:**
```
L-Theanine → ↑ Alpha waves (8-12 Hz) → Relaxed alertness
          → ↑ GABA, Serotonin, Dopamine modulation
          → ↓ Glutamate (excitatory) signaling
          → ↓ Cortisol and stress markers
```

**Why theanine for sleep:**
- **Anxiolytic:** Quiets racing thoughts without cognitive impairment
- **Transition support:** Bridges the gap between active mind and sleep
- **Non-sedating:** Won't make you drowsy if taken too early
- **Synergy:** Enhances effects of other sleep compounds

**Research highlights:**
- Improved sleep quality in boys with ADHD (Lyon 2011)
- Reduced resting heart rate and stress markers (Kimura 2007)
- Enhanced alpha wave production (Nobre 2008)
- No tolerance development with chronic use

<Tip>
**The meditation molecule:** L-Theanine produces the brain state that monks achieve through years of practice. It doesn't force sleep — it creates the conditions where sleep happens naturally.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Apigenin — 50mg" icon="flower">

**What it does:** A flavonoid from chamomile that acts as a positive allosteric modulator at GABA-A receptors — enhancing GABA's calming effects without directly activating the receptor (avoiding sedation and dependency).

**Why this dose:** 50mg is the dose popularized by sleep researchers and used in clinical practice. It provides meaningful GABA-A modulation without the risks of stronger GABAergics.

**GABA-A modulation (the safe way):**
```
Benzodiazepines → Direct GABA-A activation → Sedation, dependency, tolerance

Apigenin → Positive allosteric modulation → Enhanced GABA response
        → Only works when GABA is naturally released
        → No dependency, no tolerance, no morning hangover
```

**Bonus mechanism — CD38 inhibition:**
- CD38 is a major NAD+ consumer
- Apigenin inhibits CD38, preserving NAD+ levels
- NAD+ supports cellular repair during sleep
- Longevity benefit layered on sleep benefit

**Safety profile:**
- No tolerance development
- No dependency risk
- No respiratory depression
- No cognitive impairment
- Safe for long-term use

<Warning>
**Not a benzodiazepine:** Apigenin is sometimes described as "nature's Xanax." This undersells its safety — it's mechanistically distinct, working with your GABA system rather than overriding it.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Ashwagandha (KSM-66®) — 300mg" icon="leaf">

**What it does:** In Recover, ashwagandha serves a different role than in Sustain — here it's about HPA axis recovery and overnight cortisol normalization, not daytime stress management.

**Why evening dosing:**
- Cortisol should reach its nadir during sleep
- Elevated nighttime cortisol disrupts sleep architecture
- Ashwagandha accelerates the evening cortisol decline
- Supports the natural cortisol rhythm reset that happens overnight

**Sleep-specific benefits:**
- **HPA reset:** Normalizes dysregulated cortisol patterns
- **Sleep quality:** Multiple trials show improved sleep scores
- **Recovery:** Enhanced physical and mental restoration
- **Anxiety reduction:** Quiets the rumination that prevents sleep

**Research highlight (Langade 2019):**
- 300mg KSM-66 at bedtime for 8 weeks
- 72% improvement in sleep quality scores
- Significant reduction in sleep onset latency
- Improved sleep efficiency

<Note>
**Morning vs. evening ashwagandha:** Sustain uses ashwagandha for daytime stress resilience. Recover uses it for overnight HPA recovery. The mechanisms overlap but the timing serves different purposes.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Zinc + Copper — 15mg / 1mg" icon="capsules">

**What it does:** Zinc supports hundreds of enzymatic reactions including neurotransmitter synthesis, immune function, and tissue repair — all of which peak during sleep. Copper is included to prevent zinc-induced copper depletion.

**Why these doses:**
- 15mg zinc is the upper range of daily intake, appropriate for overnight recovery demands
- 1mg copper maintains the critical zinc:copper ratio (15:1)
- Higher zinc without copper can cause deficiency over time

**Sleep-relevant functions:**

| Mineral | Sleep Role |
|---------|-----------|
| **Zinc** | GABA synthesis cofactor |
| **Zinc** | Melatonin production support |
| **Zinc** | Immune function during sleep |
| **Zinc** | Tissue repair and growth |
| **Copper** | Dopamine-β-hydroxylase cofactor |
| **Copper** | Antioxidant enzyme (SOD) support |

**Research insight:** Zinc deficiency is associated with poor sleep quality, and supplementation improves sleep in deficient individuals. Even marginal deficiency — common in athletes and stressed individuals — can impair sleep.

<Tip>
**The recovery minerals:** Sleep is when your body repairs. Zinc and copper are essential cofactors for the repair machinery. Providing them at bedtime ensures availability when demand peaks.
</Tip>

## How to Use Recover

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Timing" icon="clock">
**Take 30-60 minutes before bed.** Glycine needs time to induce peripheral vasodilation. L-Theanine needs time to shift brain waves. Don't take it and immediately try to sleep.
</Card>

<Card title="Consistency" icon="calendar-check">
Sleep compounds work best with consistent use. Your circadian system responds to regularity. Taking Recover at the same time nightly enhances its effectiveness.
</Card>

<Card title="Environment" icon="bed">
Recover supports sleep; it doesn't override poor sleep hygiene. Cool room (65-68°F), darkness, no screens for 30+ minutes before bed. The compound works with your biology, not against your environment.
</Card>

<Card title="Stacking" icon="layer-group">
Recover completes the **Boost** → **Sustain** → **Recover** cycle. The adaptogens from Sustain prepare your HPA axis; Recover finishes the job overnight.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Will Recover make me groggy in the morning?" icon="circle-question">
No. Unlike sedatives and antihistamines, Recover's compounds don't cause morning hangover. Glycine actually improves next-day cognitive function. If anything, you'll wake up sharper.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I take Recover if I wake up during the night?" icon="circle-question">
Recover is designed for sleep onset, not middle-of-night dosing. If you wake up, the compounds are still active from your pre-bed dose. Additional dosing isn't recommended and may cause grogginess.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I need to wake up for something important?" icon="circle-question">
Recover doesn't impair arousal to important stimuli (unlike sedatives). You'll still wake to alarms, children, or emergencies. It supports sleep; it doesn't enforce unconsciousness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is Recover safe with other sleep supplements?" icon="circle-question">
Avoid combining with other GABAergics (phenibut, high-dose melatonin, prescription sleep aids). Recover is designed as a complete sleep support system — additional compounds create unpredictable interactions.
</Accordion>
