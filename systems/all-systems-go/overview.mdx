# All Systems Go™

![Circadian Alignment](/images/circadian-alignment.png)

<Note>
**One system. Three phases. Complete optimization.** All Systems Go™ is a coordinated stack designed to support cognitive performance from morning focus through evening recovery — no overlap, no redundancy, just precision timing.
</Note>

Your biology doesn't operate on a single setting. Morning demands differ from afternoon demands differ from what your brain needs to restore overnight. All Systems Go™ respects this rhythm with three distinct formulas that hand off seamlessly throughout your day.

## The Three Phases

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Boost" icon="sun" href="/systems/all-systems-go/boost">
**Morning Activation**

Cholinergic ignition + dopaminergic support. Sharp focus, verbal fluency, and drive — right when you need it.

*Take with breakfast*
</Card>

<Card title="Sustain" icon="battery-half" href="/systems/all-systems-go/sustain">
**Midday Momentum**

Mitochondrial support + adaptogenic resilience. Maintain output without the crash.

*Take with lunch*
</Card>

<Card title="Recover" icon="moon" href="/systems/all-systems-go/recover">
**Evening Restoration**

GABAergic calm + glycinergic sleep. Deep recovery that sets up tomorrow's performance.

*Take before bed*
</Card>

## Why a System?

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Circadian Alignment" icon="clock">
Your neurotransmitter needs shift throughout the day. Acetylcholine for morning focus, cortisol management midday, GABA for evening wind-down. One formula can't optimize all three.
</Card>

<Card title="No Redundancy" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
Single-product stacks often double up on ingredients you're already getting. Our three-phase approach means each compound appears once, at the optimal time.
</Card>

<Card title="Synergistic Handoffs" icon="arrows-rotate">
Boost primes systems that Sustain maintains. Sustain prevents depletion that Recover replenishes. Each phase sets up the next.
</Card>

<Card title="Dose Precision" icon="bullseye">
Splitting across three formulas allows clinically-validated doses without horse-pill capsule counts. The right amount, at the right time.

## A Day with All Systems Go

<Steps>

<Step title="7:00 AM — Boost">
Take with breakfast. Within 30-60 minutes, cholinergic systems come online. Expect sharper focus, improved verbal recall, and sustained attention through your morning peak hours.
</Step>

<Step title="12:00 PM — Sustain">
Take with lunch. As morning neurotransmitters begin to wane, Sustain provides metabolic support and adaptogenic resilience. No afternoon slump — steady output until evening.
</Step>

<Step title="9:00 PM — Recover">
Take 30-60 minutes before bed. GABAergic calming begins, core temperature drops via glycine-mediated vasodilation, and the stage is set for deep, restorative sleep.
</Step>

<Step title="Next Morning — Repeat">
Wake up recovered, not depleted. The cycle continues — each day building on proper restoration from the night before.
</Step>

</Steps>
