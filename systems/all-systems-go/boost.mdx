# Boost — Morning Activation

<Note>
**Prime your brain for peak output.** Boost delivers the raw materials and enzymatic support your cholinergic and dopaminergic systems need to fire on all cylinders — right when your circadian biology is primed for cognitive performance.
</Note>

The first hours after waking represent a neurochemical window. Cortisol peaks (the cortisol awakening response), acetylcholine sensitivity is high, and dopaminergic circuits are ready for activation. Boost is engineered to capitalize on this window — not fight against it.

## The Science of Morning Cognition

Your brain doesn't wake up in a single moment — it phases into full operation over 60-90 minutes. During this window:

<Steps>

<Step title="Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)">
Cortisol surges 50-75% in the first 30-45 minutes after waking. This isn't stress — it's your body's ignition sequence, mobilizing energy and priming alertness.
</Step>

<Step title="Cholinergic Activation">
Acetylcholine systems shift from the diffuse activity of sleep to the focused, task-oriented signaling of wakefulness. This transition determines morning mental clarity.
</Step>

<Step title="Dopaminergic Readiness">
Dopamine circuits, refreshed by sleep, are primed for reward-seeking and goal-directed behavior. The motivation to tackle your hardest work is highest now.
</Step>

<Step title="Adenosine Clearance">
Sleep has cleared adenosine (the molecule that makes you drowsy). You're starting with a clean slate — no sleep pressure competing for attention.
</Step>

</Steps>

Boost amplifies each of these natural processes rather than overriding them.

## Complete Ingredient Breakdown

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="CDP-Choline (Cognizin®) — 250mg" icon="droplet">

**What it does:** Provides choline for acetylcholine synthesis while simultaneously delivering uridine — a nucleotide that supports dopamine receptor density and phospholipid membrane synthesis.

**Why this dose:** 250mg provides meaningful cognitive enhancement without the potential for cholinergic overload when combined with Alpha-GPC. The Cognizin® form is the most clinically-validated CDP-Choline, with human trials demonstrating:
- Improved attention and psychomotor speed
- Enhanced memory performance
- Increased brain ATP levels (+14%)
- Elevated phosphocreatine (+7%)

**Mechanism pathway:**
```
CDP-Choline → Choline + Cytidine
                ↓           ↓
         Acetylcholine   Uridine → Phosphatidylcholine
                              ↓
                    Dopamine receptor density ↑
```

<Tip>
**Synergy:** CDP-Choline's uridine component enhances dopamine receptor expression, amplifying the effects of L-Tyrosine in the same formula.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alpha-GPC — 300mg" icon="bolt">

**What it does:** The highest-bioavailability choline source, delivering choline directly across the blood-brain barrier for rapid acetylcholine synthesis.

**Why this dose:** 300mg provides acute cholinergic enhancement without the GI distress sometimes seen at higher doses. Combined with CDP-Choline, total choline delivery is optimized for both speed (Alpha-GPC) and sustained effect (CDP-Choline).

**Unique benefits:**
- Fastest choline delivery to CNS
- Supports growth hormone release (particularly relevant for morning dosing)
- Membrane phospholipid donor (phosphatidylcholine precursor)

**Research highlight:** Alpha-GPC has demonstrated cognitive benefits in both young, healthy subjects and age-related cognitive decline — suggesting it enhances a fundamental bottleneck rather than compensating for pathology.

<Warning>
**TMAO consideration:** Choline can be converted to TMAO by gut bacteria. By splitting choline delivery across two sources and timing Boost for morning (when gut bacteria are less active), we minimize this concern. Occasional users need not worry; daily users should ensure adequate fiber intake.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="L-Tyrosine — 500mg" icon="arrow-up">

**What it does:** Direct precursor to dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine — the catecholamine neurotransmitters that drive motivation, focus, and stress resilience.

**Why this dose:** 500mg is the minimum effective dose for cognitive enhancement in demanding situations. Higher doses (2g+) are sometimes used but offer diminishing returns and can cause jitteriness.

**When tyrosine shines:**
- Sleep deprivation (protects cognitive function)
- Acute stress (replenishes depleted catecholamines)
- Demanding cognitive tasks (working memory, multitasking)
- Cold exposure (supports thermogenic response)

**Mechanism pathway:**
```
L-Tyrosine → L-DOPA → Dopamine → Norepinephrine → Epinephrine
         (TH + BH4)  (AADC + B6)   (DBH + Vit C)    (PNMT + SAMe)
```

<Note>
**Rate-limiting reality:** Tyrosine conversion to L-DOPA via tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting step. This enzyme is regulated by catecholamine levels — meaning tyrosine supplementation is most effective when catecholamines are depleted (stress, sleep loss, demanding work).
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Huperzine A — 100mcg" icon="shield">

**What it does:** Reversibly inhibits acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine. This prolongs acetylcholine signaling in the synaptic cleft.

**Why this dose:** 100mcg is a conservative, well-tolerated dose that provides meaningful AChE inhibition without the side effects (nausea, bradycardia) seen at higher doses. The long half-life (10-14 hours) means once-daily dosing is appropriate.

**Key properties:**
- Highly selective for AChE (minimal BuChE inhibition)
- Excellent blood-brain barrier penetration
- Neuroprotective against glutamate excitotoxicity
- May support neurogenesis via BDNF

**Cycling consideration:** Due to the long half-life and potent AChE inhibition, some users prefer to cycle Huperzine A (5 days on, 2 days off). Boost is designed to be effective with daily use, but listen to your body.

<Warning>
**Interaction alert:** Huperzine A should not be combined with pharmaceutical acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) or drugs with anticholinergic properties.
</Warning>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus) — 500mg" icon="seedling">

**What it does:** Stimulates Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) synthesis via unique compounds called hericenones (fruiting body) and erinacines (mycelium). NGF supports neuronal health, synaptic plasticity, and potentially neurogenesis.

**Why this dose:** 500mg of a quality extract (containing both hericenones and erinacines) provides meaningful NGF support. This is a long-term neuroplasticity play — effects build over weeks to months.

**Research highlights:**
- Improved cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (Mori 2009)
- Reduced anxiety and depression scores (Nagano 2010)
- Enhanced nerve regeneration in animal models
- Unique among nootropics for structural brain support

**Onset expectations:**
- Acute effects: Subtle (some report mild clarity)
- 2-4 weeks: Emerging cognitive benefits
- 8-16 weeks: Full neuroplasticity effects

<Tip>
**Patience pays:** Lion's Mane isn't a stimulant — it's an investment in brain infrastructure. The benefits compound over time.
</Tip>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="B-Complex (Methylated)" icon="capsules">

**What it does:** Provides essential cofactors for neurotransmitter synthesis, methylation, and energy metabolism — in their active, bioavailable forms.

| Vitamin | Form | Role in Boost |
|---------|------|---------------|
| B6 | P-5-P | AADC cofactor (DOPA → Dopamine) |
| B9 | 5-MTHF | Methylation; BH4 regeneration |
| B12 | Methylcobalamin | Methylation; nerve function |
| B1 | Benfotiamine | Glucose metabolism; ATP |
| B2 | Riboflavin-5-P | MTHFR cofactor; ETC Complex II |
| B5 | Pantethine | Acetyl-CoA synthesis |

**Why methylated forms:** Up to 40% of the population has MTHFR polymorphisms that impair folate metabolism. Methylated B-vitamins bypass this bottleneck, ensuring the cofactors actually work.
