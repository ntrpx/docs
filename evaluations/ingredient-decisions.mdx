| **Valerian** | Variable efficacy; potential liver concerns with chronic use; GABAergic coverage adequate with Mg/Theanine/Taurine |
| **Kava** | Hepatotoxicity concerns; regulatory restrictions in some markets; not appropriate for daily consumer use |
| **5-HTP** | Serotonin syndrome risk with other serotonergics; peripheral conversion issues; serotonin needs addressed via Bacopa/Saffron |
| **Tryptophan** | Better to support via cofactors; 5-HTP conversion issues; B6 requirement complicates dosing |

---

## Structural & Cellular Ingredients

### ✅ INCLUDED

| Ingredient | Product(s) | Dose | Rationale |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----|:----------|
| **Phosphatidylserine** (Sharp-PS®) | Sustain™, Sprint™ | 100mg | Membrane fluidity; cortisol modulation; TIER 1 evidence; sunflower-derived (no soy concerns) |

---

## Cardiovascular / NO Ingredients

### ✅ INCLUDED

| Ingredient | Product(s) | Dose | Rationale |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----|:----------|
| **L-Citrulline** | Sol™ | 3g | Superior to arginine (80% vs 20% bioavailability); sustained NO production; bypasses arginase |

### ❌ EXCLUDED

| Ingredient | Reason for Exclusion |
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| **L-Arginine** | CRITICAL: Poor oral bioavailability (~20%); extensive first-pass metabolism; L-Citrulline superior in every metric |
| **AAKG (Arginine Alpha-Ketoglutarate)** | Same bioavailability issues as L-arginine; L-Citrulline still superior |
| **Nitrosigine®** | Acceptable alternative to L-Citrulline; not included to avoid redundancy; could substitute in future versions |

---

## Essential Nutrients (B-Vitamins)

### ✅ INCLUDED (Active Forms ONLY)

| Vitamin | Form Included | Form Excluded | Critical Rationale |
|:--------|:--------------|:--------------|:-------------------|
| **B1** | Benfotiamine + TTFD | Thiamine mononitrate | Higher bioavailability; TTFD crosses BBB; AGE inhibition |
| **B2** | Riboflavin-5'-Phosphate (R5P) | Riboflavin | Active coenzyme; no conversion required; supports B6/B9/B3 activation |
| **B3** | Nicotinamide + NR | Niacin (flushing), Nicotinic acid | NAD+ support without flush; NR superior precursor |
| **B5** | D-Calcium Pantothenate | — | Standard form effective; no superior alternative |
| **B6** | Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate (P5P) | **PYRIDOXINE HCl** | **CRITICAL: Pyridoxine causes documented peripheral neuropathy; competitive P5P inhibition; ONLY P5P is acceptable** |
| **B7** | D-Biotin | L-Biotin, DL-Biotin | D-form is active; keep \<1000mcg to avoid lab interference |
| **B9** | L-5-MTHF (Quatrefolic®) | **FOLIC ACID** | **CRITICAL: 30%+ population has MTHFR variants; folic acid masks B12 deficiency; unmetabolized folic acid concerns; ONLY L-5-MTHF acceptable** |
| **B12** | Methylcobalamin + Adenosylcobalamin | **CYANOCOBALAMIN** | **CRITICAL: Cyanocobalamin requires conversion + has cyanide moiety; both coenzyme forms needed for complete coverage** |

<Warning>
**B-VITAMIN FORMS ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE**

The excluded forms (Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Cyanocobalamin) are not just "less optimal" — they pose real safety concerns:
- Pyridoxine: Neurotoxicity documented at doses >200mg/day, and even lower with chronic use
- Folic Acid: May be harmful to MTHFR variants (30%+ population); masks B12 deficiency
- Cyanocobalamin: Cyanide moiety requires detoxification; inefficient conversion

**The NTRPX Meta System™ uses ONLY active coenzyme forms.**
</Warning>

| **Caffeine** | Sprint™ only | 100mg | Broader receptor profile for acute; reserved for occasional high-demand |
| **Theobromine** | ParaCaffeine +™ | 50mg | Mild, long-acting; smooth energy curve; vasodilatory; complements paraxanthine |

### ❌ EXCLUDED

| Ingredient | Reason for Exclusion |
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| **Caffeine (daily use)** | Replaced by paraxanthine; caffeine's anxiogenic metabolites (theophylline) and longer half-life make paraxanthine superior for daily use |
| **Synephrine** | Cardiovascular concerns; regulatory issues; not needed with paraxanthine available |
| **Yohimbine** | Anxiety, blood pressure concerns; narrow therapeutic window; too risky for consumer supplement |
| **DMAA, DMHA, etc.** | Banned/restricted stimulants; severe safety concerns; absolutely inappropriate |
