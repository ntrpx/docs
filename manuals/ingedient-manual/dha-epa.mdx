# Omega-3 Fatty Acids: DHA & EPA

<Note>
**The Brain's Building Blocks & The Body's Resolution System.** Your brain is nearly 60% fat by dry weight, and DHA is the single most abundant omega-3 in neural tissue — comprising 40% of all polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain and 50% of the weight of a neuronal plasma membrane. EPA, while less concentrated in the brain, serves as the precursor to specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that actively terminate inflammation. Together, DHA and EPA represent perhaps the most important nutritional interventions for cognitive longevity and systemic health. NTRPX employs AvailOm® lysine complex technology to deliver these essential fatty acids with **5-9× greater bioavailability** than standard supplements.

## Executive Summary

### Why Omega-3s Are Non-Negotiable

| Domain | DHA Role | EPA Role |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Brain Structure** | Primary structural component of neuronal membranes; 50% of membrane weight | Minimal brain storage; passes through for SPM synthesis |
| **Cognitive Function** | Membrane fluidity → synaptic plasticity, neurotransmission | Reduces neuroinflammation → protects cognitive function |
| **Mood Regulation** | Serotonin receptor function; membrane dynamics | **Primary antidepressant effect**; inflammation modulation |
| **Cardiovascular** | Mild triglyceride effects | **Primary cardioprotective** agent; anti-inflammatory |
| **Inflammation** | Precursor to D-series resolvins, protectins, maresins | Precursor to E-series resolvins |
| **Eye Health** | 60% of retinal PUFAs; photoreceptor integrity | Supporting role |

### The Problem with Standard Omega-3 Supplements

Most fish oil supplements use **ethyl ester (EE)** forms for cost-effective purification. The problem:

1. **Requires enzymatic hydrolysis** — Pancreatic lipase must cleave the ethyl group before absorption
2. **Bile-dependent** — Poor absorption without adequate dietary fat
3. **Slow absorption** — Peak plasma levels delayed 8-12 hours
4. **Variable bioavailability** — 20-60% absorption depending on meal composition

### The NTRPX Solution: AvailOm® Lysine Complex

NTRPX Systems utilize **AvailOm®** from Evonik — a revolutionary omega-3 delivery system that complexes free fatty acids with the essential amino acid L-lysine:

| Feature | AvailOm® | Standard Ethyl Ester | Standard Triglyceride |
|---------|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Bioavailability** | **5-9× higher** vs EE | Baseline | 1.4-1.6× vs EE |
| **Requires Fat** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Requires Bile** | No | Yes | Yes |
| **Peak Absorption** | 2-4 hours | 8-12 hours | 6-8 hours |
| **Stability** | >4 years | 1-2 years | 2-3 years |
| **Format** | Powder (versatile) | Oil (capsules) | Oil (capsules) |

</Card>

### The Brain's Fat Dependency

The human brain is a lipid-rich organ:

- **60% fat by dry weight** — highest fat percentage of any organ except adipose
- **78% of myelin sheath** is lipid — the insulating layer around axons
- **Phospholipids** comprise 55% of brain lipid content
- **DHA is the most abundant omega-3** in the brain and retina

DHA specifically:
- Comprises **40% of all PUFAs** in the brain
- Comprises **60% of PUFAs** in the retina
- Makes up **50% of neuronal plasma membrane** weight
- Is **30%+ of phosphatidylserine (PS)** fatty acid content in neurons

### Why DHA Cannot Be Replaced

The brain has an absolute preference for DHA. When DHA is depleted, the body attempts compensation with **docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5n-6)** — an omega-6 analog. However:

- DPA has **different membrane properties** than DHA
- Phospholipids containing DPA are **inferior substrates** for phosphatidylserine synthesis
- This results in **reduced PS levels** and **impaired neuronal function**
- Studies show DHA-depleted animals have **impaired learning and memory**

### Mechanisms of DHA Action

#### 1. Membrane Fluidity & Architecture

DHA has **six double bonds** in a 22-carbon chain — the most unsaturated common fatty acid. This creates:

- **Extreme flexibility** — the carbon chain rapidly isomerizes between conformations
- **Increased membrane fluidity** — allows embedded proteins to move and function
- **Optimal receptor function** — G-protein coupled receptors require fluid membranes
- **Enhanced neurotransmitter release** — vesicle fusion depends on membrane dynamics

**Mechanism Detail:**
DHA's six cis double bonds create a kinked, highly flexible structure. When incorporated into membrane phospholipids, DHA molecules create "loose packing" areas that increase membrane fluidity. This fluidity is essential for:
- Neurotransmitter receptor conformational changes
- Ion channel gating
- Synaptic vesicle fusion and recycling
- Signal transduction cascades

#### 2. Phosphatidylserine (PS) Synthesis & Neuronal Survival

DHA-containing phospholipids (PC and PE) are the **preferred substrates** for PS biosynthesis in the brain. This matters because:

- **PS is the major anionic phospholipid** in the inner leaflet of neuronal membranes
- PS concentrations in **brain gray matter are exceptionally high** (15-20% of phospholipids)
- PS provides **negative charge** essential for recruiting signaling proteins

**The Akt Survival Pathway:**
1. DHA supplementation → increased membrane PS content
2. Increased PS → enhanced Akt membrane translocation
3. Akt activation → phosphorylation of pro-survival targets
4. Result: **Enhanced neuronal survival under stress**

Studies show DHA-supplemented neurons are protected against:
- Serum starvation
- Oxidative stress
- Amyloid-β toxicity
- Glutamate excitotoxicity

#### 3. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)

DHA increases BDNF through:
- **CREB phosphorylation** activation
- **Epigenetic modulation** of BDNF gene expression
- **Reduced BDNF methylation** (epigenetic silencing)

BDNF is the brain's "fertilizer" — it:
- Promotes neurogenesis (new neuron formation)
- Supports synaptic plasticity
- Enhances learning and memory consolidation
- Protects against neurodegeneration

#### 4. Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (D-Series)

DHA is the precursor for **D-series resolvins, protectins, and maresins** — collectively called Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators (SPMs):

| SPM Family | Key Members | Primary Actions |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **D-Series Resolvins** | RvD1, RvD2, RvD3, RvD4, RvD5, RvD6 | Stop neutrophil infiltration; promote macrophage phagocytosis |
| **Protectins** | PD1 (Neuroprotectin D1 in neural tissue) | Potent neuroprotection; anti-apoptotic; blocks leukocyte transmigration |
| **Maresins** | MaR1, MaR2 | Macrophage-mediated tissue repair; regeneration signaling |

**Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1)** is of particular importance:
- Synthesized in the brain from DHA via 15-LOX
- **Potently neuroprotective** — picomolar concentrations effective
- Inhibits amyloid-β-induced apoptosis
- Reduces oxidative stress-induced cell death
- Modulates microglial activation toward protective phenotype

### DHA Deficiency: Consequences

| System | Deficiency Consequence |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Brain Development** | Impaired visual acuity, cognitive deficits |
| **Adult Cognition** | Reduced memory, processing speed, executive function |
| **Mood** | Increased depression risk; serotonin receptor dysfunction |
| **Neurodegeneration** | Accelerated decline; reduced PS levels in Alzheimer's |
| **Retina** | Visual dysfunction; photoreceptor degeneration |

| **Products** | ASG Boost™ (300mg), ASG Recover™ (300mg) |
| **Primary Function** | Inflammation resolution, cardiovascular protection, mood regulation |

</Card>

### EPA: The Anti-Inflammatory Omega-3

Unlike DHA, which accumulates extensively in neural membranes, **EPA passes through** the brain more transiently. Its magic lies in what it becomes:

1. **Not highly stored in brain phospholipids** at steady state
2. **Rapidly metabolized** when it enters the brain
3. **Converted to SPMs** that resolve inflammation
4. **Competes with arachidonic acid** for enzymatic conversion

### Mechanisms of EPA Action

#### 1. Competition with Arachidonic Acid (AA)

Arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) is the precursor to **pro-inflammatory eicosanoids**:
- Prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2)
- Thromboxanes (TXA2)
- Leukotrienes (LTB4)

EPA competes with AA at multiple levels:

**Membrane Competition:**
- EPA and AA compete for incorporation into phospholipids
- Higher EPA → lower membrane AA content
- Less AA available for release during inflammation

**Enzyme Competition:**
- EPA competes for COX-1, COX-2, and lipoxygenases
- EPA-derived products are **less inflammatory** than AA-derived
- Example: PGE3 (from EPA) is less inflammatory than PGE2 (from AA)

**Δ5-Desaturase Inhibition:**
- EPA inhibits Δ5-desaturase
- This reduces conversion of DGLA → AA
- Further decreases AA production

#### 2. E-Series Resolvins

EPA is converted to **E-series resolvins** via cytochrome P450 and lipoxygenase pathways:

| Resolvin | Biosynthesis | Key Actions |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **RvE1** | EPA → 18-HEPE → RvE1 (via 5-LOX) | Stops neutrophil transmigration; promotes macrophage efferocytosis |
| **RvE2** | EPA → 18-HEPE → RvE2 | Anti-inflammatory; regulates chemokine production |
| **RvE3** | EPA → 17,18-diHETE → RvE3 | Anti-inflammatory; tissue protection |

These resolvins signal through specific GPCRs:
- **ChemR23 (ERV1)**: RvE1 receptor on monocytes, dendritic cells
- **BLT1**: RvE1 also binds leukotriene B4 receptor (antagonist)
- **CMKLR1**: RvE2 receptor

#### 3. Depression & Mood: EPA's Domain

Meta-analyses consistently show **EPA is the active antidepressant** in omega-3 research:

**Key Findings (Multiple Meta-Analyses):**
- EPA-predominant formulations (≥60% EPA) show **significant antidepressant effects**
- DHA-predominant formulations show **minimal to no benefit** for depression
- Optimal dose appears to be **1-2g EPA per day**
- Effect size: SMD = -0.28 to -0.50 (small to medium effect)

**Proposed Mechanisms:**
1. **Anti-inflammatory**: Depression associated with elevated IL-6, TNF-α, CRP — EPA reduces these
2. **Neuroplasticity**: EPA increases N-acetyl-aspartate (neuronal marker) in brain
3. **Phospholipid turnover**: EPA increases cerebral phosphomonoester/phosphodiester ratio
4. **Serotonin modulation**: Indirect effects via inflammation-neurotransmitter crosstalk

**Clinical Pearl:** EPA appears most effective in patients with **elevated inflammatory markers** (high CRP). This supports the inflammation-depression hypothesis and suggests EPA works by resolving neuroinflammation.

#### 4. Cardiovascular Protection

EPA's cardiovascular benefits include:

| Effect | Mechanism | Evidence Level |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Triglyceride Reduction** | Reduced hepatic VLDL synthesis; increased lipoprotein lipase | Strong (FDA-approved doses) |
| **Anti-platelet** | Reduced TXA2; increased TXA3 | Moderate |
| **Anti-arrhythmic** | Ion channel modulation; membrane stabilization | Moderate |
| **Endothelial Function** | Increased NO production; reduced inflammation | Moderate |
| **Plaque Stabilization** | Reduced macrophage inflammation in atheroma | Emerging |

### The Science of Lysine Complexation

Traditional omega-3 delivery faces fundamental chemistry challenges:

**Ethyl Esters (EE):**
- Requires hydrolysis by pancreatic lipase
- Must be emulsified by bile salts
- Absorption is **highly fat-dependent**
- Poor absorption on empty stomach

**Triglycerides (TG):**
- Better than EE but still requires lipase and bile
- Moderately fat-dependent

**AvailOm® Free Fatty Acid-Lysine Complex:**
1. Complexation with L-lysine creates a **stable solid powder**
2. In the stomach, the complex **rapidly dissociates** to free fatty acids + lysine
3. Free fatty acids are **directly absorbed** by enterocytes
4. **No enzymatic hydrolysis required**
5. **No bile salt emulsification needed**
6. Absorption occurs **even on an empty stomach**

### Clinical Evidence for Superior Bioavailability

**Wageningen University Study (2020):**
- First in-human pharmacokinetic trial
- 8 healthy female volunteers

## Part IV: DHA & EPA in the NTRPX Ecosystem

### Product Placement Strategy

| Product | DHA (mg) | EPA (mg) | Total ω-3 | Form | Rationale |
|---------|----------|----------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **ASG Boost™** | 400 | 300 | 700 | AvailOm® High DHA | Morning foundation; structural + anti-inflammatory |
| **ASG Sustain™** | 200 | 100 | 300 | AvailOm® High DHA | Afternoon continuation; cognitive maintenance |
| **ASG Recover™** | 100 | 300 | 400 | AvailOm® 50 High EPA | Evening recovery; EPA-dominant for inflammation resolution |

**Daily Total:** 700mg DHA + 700mg EPA = **1,400mg combined EPA+DHA**

### Synergies within NTRPX Systems

#### DHA + Phosphatidylserine (PS)

DHA increases membrane PS content → PS is included in ASG Boost™ → amplified effect:
- DHA provides substrate for PS-DHA synthesis
- Exogenous PS provides additional PS
- Result: **Maximized Akt activation and neuronal protection**

#### EPA + Curcumin (ASG Recover™)

Both EPA and curcumin target inflammation through complementary mechanisms:
- EPA → E-series resolvins → resolution of inflammation
- Curcumin → NF-κB inhibition → prevention of inflammatory cascade
- Combined: **Synergistic anti-inflammatory effect**

#### DHA + Vitamin D3 + K2 (ASG Boost™)

The "fat-soluble synergy triad":
- DHA: Structural lipid requiring adequate vitamin D for metabolism
- Vitamin D3: Regulates serotonin synthesis (TPH2) — DHA enhances receptor function
- Vitamin K2: Prevents vascular calcification; neuroprotective via Gas6
- Combined with AvailOm® oil matrix: **Enhanced absorption of D3 and K2**

#### Omega-3 + B-Vitamins (Homocysteine)

Both omega-3s and B-vitamins (B6, B9, B12) reduce homocysteine and cardiovascular risk:
- B-vitamins: Direct homocysteine metabolism (methionine cycle)
- Omega-3s: Reduce inflammatory consequences of elevated homocysteine
- Combined: **Additive cardiovascular and cognitive protection**

#### Omega-3 + Magnesium

Magnesium is required for proper omega-3 metabolism:
- Mg2+ is a cofactor for enzymes in fatty acid metabolism
- Mg2+ modulates membrane fluidity (synergistic with DHA)
- Both support healthy inflammation response
- Combined: **Optimized omega-3 utilization**

### Circadian Considerations

| Time | Product | Omega-3 Emphasis | Rationale |
|------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Morning** | ASG Boost™ | DHA-dominant (400mg) | Structural foundation; cognitive priming |
| **Afternoon** | ASG Sustain™ | Moderate DHA (200mg) | Sustained cognitive support; no stimulation |
| **Evening** | ASG Recover™ | EPA-dominant (300mg) | Inflammation resolution; recovery optimization |

**Why EPA in the evening?**
- Resolution of the day's inflammatory burden
- Sleep involves tissue repair (anti-inflammatory state)
- EPA-derived resolvins support nocturnal recovery
- Synergy with magnesium glycinate (ASG Recover™) for relaxation

## Part V: Whole Food Sources — The Dietary Context

<Note>
**Food First, Supplements to Optimize.** While NTRPX Systems deliver precise, bioavailable omega-3s, understanding whole food sources helps contextualize doses and supports overall dietary strategy. The challenge: achieving optimal omega-3 status through diet alone is difficult for most people.
</Note>

### Omega-3 Content of Common Foods

| Food Source | Serving | DHA (mg) | EPA (mg) | Total ω-3 (mg) |
|-------------|---------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Atlantic Salmon (wild)** | 3 oz (85g) | 1,240 | 590 | 1,830 |
| **Atlantic Salmon (farmed)** | 3 oz (85g) | 1,090 | 590 | 1,680 |
| **Atlantic Mackerel** | 3 oz (85g) | 1,400 | 500 | 4,580* |
| **Sardines (canned)** | 3 oz (85g) | 740 | 450 | 1,190 |
| **Herring** | 3 oz (85g) | 940 | 770 | 1,710 |
| **Anchovies** | 3 oz (85g) | 870 | 760 | 1,630 |
| **Rainbow Trout (farmed)** | 3 oz (85g) | 500 | 400 | 900 |
| **Albacore Tuna** | 3 oz (85g) | 530 | 200 | 730 |
| **Oysters** | 3 oz (85g) | 200 | 260 | 460 |
| **Cod** | 3 oz (85g) | 130 | 50 | 180 |

*Mackerel includes additional omega-3s beyond EPA+DHA

### Food Equivalents for NTRPX Daily Dose

To match the **1,400mg combined EPA+DHA** from one full day of NTRPX Systems (Boost + Sustain + Recover), you would need to consume:

| Food | Amount Needed | Practical? | Notes |
|------|---------------|------------|-------|
| **Wild Salmon** | ~2.5 oz (70g) | ✓ Practical | ~3 servings/week achievable |
| **Sardines** | ~3.5 oz (100g) | ✓ Practical | 1 can = ~3 oz |
| **Herring** | ~2.5 oz (70g) | ✓ Practical | Pickled or smoked available |
| **Albacore Tuna** | ~6 oz (170g) | ⚠️ Mercury concern | Limit to 6 oz/week |
| **Cod** | ~24 oz (680g) | ✗ Impractical | Very low omega-3 content |
| **Shrimp** | ~47 oz (1.3kg) | ✗ Impractical | Minimal omega-3 |

### The Math Problem

The American Heart Association recommends **1-2 servings of fatty fish per week** for cardiovascular health. Let's calculate:

**Average American fish consumption:** 
- ~1 serving (3 oz) fatty fish per week
- Provides: ~600-800mg EPA+DHA per week
- Daily average: **85-115mg EPA+DHA**

**Recommended intake for optimal health:**
- General: 250-500mg EPA+DHA daily
- Cardiovascular disease: 1,000mg EPA+DHA daily
- Elevated triglycerides: 2,000-4,000mg EPA+DHA daily

**The Gap:**
Most Americans get ~100mg/day but need 250-1,000mg/day. That's a **2.5-10× deficit** that supplementation addresses.

### Why Supplementation Makes Sense

| Factor | Whole Fish | AvailOm® Supplement |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Consistency** | Variable (species, season, preparation) | Standardized |
| **Mercury/PCBs** | Concerns with large fish | Purified; tested |
| **Convenience** | Requires purchasing, storing, cooking | Encapsulated or powdered |
| **Taste** | Some find fish unpalatable | No fishy taste with AvailOm® |
| **Cost** | High-quality salmon expensive | More economical per mg ω-3 |
| **Bioavailability** | Variable | Consistent; 5-9× vs ethyl esters |
| **Sustainability** | Overfishing concerns | Certified sustainable sourcing |

### Dietary Strategy for NTRPX Users

**Aim for synergy:** Use NTRPX omega-3s as a reliable base, then add whole food sources when practical:

1. **Baseline:** ASG Boost™ + Sustain™ + Recover™ = 1,400mg EPA+DHA daily
2. **Bonus:** 2 servings fatty fish per week = +200-400mg EPA+DHA average daily
3. **Total:** ~1,600-1,800mg EPA+DHA daily — optimal range

**Best whole food additions:**
- Canned sardines (convenient, inexpensive, sustainable)
- Wild salmon (1-2x/week)
- Mackerel (high omega-3, moderate mercury)
- Oysters (bonus zinc, B12, and other minerals)

*Pregnant women should ensure at least 200-300mg DHA daily per international guidelines

### Timing Recommendations

**With Fat-Containing Meals (Traditional Omega-3s):**
Standard fish oil requires dietary fat for optimal absorption — take with meals containing at least 10-15g fat.

**AvailOm® Advantage:**
Because AvailOm® delivers omega-3s as free fatty acids (not requiring bile or lipase), it can be taken:
- With or without food
- On an empty stomach (still fully absorbed)
- With low-fat meals (no absorption penalty)

**NTRPX Protocol:**
- **ASG Boost™** (morning, with breakfast) — pairs with fat-soluble vitamins (D, K, E)
- **ASG Sustain™** (afternoon, with or without food) — flexibility for schedule
- **ASG Recover™** (evening, with dinner or before bed) — supports overnight recovery

### Safety Profile

**Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS):**
EPA and DHA from fish oil have GRAS status and are extremely well-tolerated.

**Upper Limits:**
- FDA: Up to 3g/day EPA+DHA from supplements is safe
- EFSA: Up to 5g/day EPA+DHA is safe for most adults
- NTRPX daily dose (1.4g) is well within safe range

**Potential Side Effects (Dose-Dependent):**

| Effect | Likelihood | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Fishy aftertaste** | AvailOm®: Rare | No fishy taste with lysine complex |
| **GI upset** | Low | More common with ethyl esters |
| **Bleeding (theoretical)** | Very low | Only at very high doses (>3g) |
| **LDL increase** | Possible | High-dose fish oil can raise LDL modestly |

**Drug Interactions:**

| Drug Class | Interaction | Recommendation |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Anticoagulants** (warfarin, heparin) | Additive bleeding risk | Monitor INR; consult physician |
| **Antiplatelet agents** (aspirin, clopidogrel) | Additive bleeding risk | Generally safe; monitor |
| **Blood pressure medications** | Additive BP lowering | Monitor BP; may allow dose reduction |
| **Diabetes medications** | Minimal | Monitor glucose (fish oil may slightly raise) |

**Contraindications:**

### The Bottom Line

Omega-3 fatty acids aren't optional — they're essential building blocks that your body cannot manufacture. DHA literally builds your brain; EPA keeps your body from destroying itself through unresolved inflammation. Most people are woefully deficient.

NTRPX Systems solve this problem with AvailOm® technology — delivering highly bioavailable EPA and DHA in precise, circadian-optimized doses across the product suite. The result: structural support for cognition, resolution capacity for inflammation, and cardiovascular protection — all without the fishy burps, variable absorption, or quality concerns of standard fish oil supplements.

**Your neurons will thank you.**
