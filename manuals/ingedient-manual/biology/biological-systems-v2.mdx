# The 16 Biological Systems

The NTRPX Meta System™ is built on a comprehensive biological framework. Rather than chasing individual ingredients or trends, we mapped the complete terrain of human physiology relevant to cognitive performance, energy, and recovery.

The result: **16 distinct biological systems** that collectively govern how you think, feel, perform, and restore.

This framework is the engineering blueprint behind every NTRPX formulation. Each product was designed with explicit knowledge of which systems it targets, when those systems need support, and how ingredients interact across pathways.

The result: supplementation architecture that works *with* human biology.
