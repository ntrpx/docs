## Cognizin Citicoline

<Card title="CDP-Choline Precursor" icon="brain" img="/images/ntrpx-placeholder.png">

**CDP-choline precursor that increases brain ATP by 14% and supports acetylcholine/dopamine synthesis.** Provides both cytidine (converted to uridine for RNA synthesis) and choline (for phosphatidylcholine membranes). The most clinically-validated nootropic choline source with robust human trial data for memory and attention.
